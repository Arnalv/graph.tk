## What is it?
This is a web application that graphs multiple functions, calculates expressions, and graphically solves differential equations.

### Try it out
graph.tk is the website which this code is used on. The version there is pretty old though.

### Requirements:
* JQuery
* MathQuill
* A browser that supports the html5 canvas tag.

## Plans
### Minor Ideas
* Automatically select all on function creation
* allow things like dy/dx x
* allow things like &int;x dx

### Big Ideas
* 3D! the whole graph thing rotates in an animation to become a flat plane, and then the 3d function is plotted. It can be done! I made [this](http://url3.tk/3d/).
