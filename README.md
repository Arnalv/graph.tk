## What is it?
This is a web application that graphs multiple functions, calculates expressions, and graphically solves differential equations.

### Try it out
[graph.tk](http://graph.tk/) is the website which this code is used on. This repository is more up to date, but currently has bugs.

### Requirements:
* JQuery
* MathQuill
* A browser that supports the html5 canvas tag.

### More information about this application.
* [Install Graph.tk as a Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkhkaamdeplibnmodcgodlkghphdbahk)
* http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/graph-plotter/
* http://graph.tk/about

## Plans
### Minor Ideas
* allow things like dy/dx x
* allow things like &int;x dx

### Big Ideas
* 3D! the whole graph thing rotates in an animation to become a flat plane, and then the 3d function is plotted.
* CAS - Not likely to happen, but it would be cool
