graph.tk is the website which this code is used on.

This is a web application that graphs multiple functions, calculates expressions, and graphically solves differential equations.

Requirements:
 * JQuery - included in main.js
 * MathQuill - for awesome math rendering - included in main.js

They are included in there because the whole thing needs to be able to run as an Offline Web application.

At the moment this requires a browser that supports the html5 canvas tag.
